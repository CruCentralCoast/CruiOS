	13.	Arbitration
Unless you are an employee of Cru and subject to Cru’s internal dispute resolution policy, for any dispute you have with Cru regarding this Mobile App, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  If Cru has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  Unless you and Cru agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the state or federal courts in Orange County, Florida, United States of America.  Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.  The award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Mobile App.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CRU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

	14.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.  We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court in Orange County, Florida for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).

Cru reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose.

By continuing to access or use this Mobile App after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.  If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using this Mobile App.

Assignment.  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Cru without restriction.  Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof will be null and void.

Entire Agreement/Severability.  These Terms, together with the Privacy Notice and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Cru in connection with this Mobile App, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Cru concerning this Mobile App.  If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

No Waiver.  No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Cru’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</string>

You agree that in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement, Cru shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, or both, in each case without the requirement to post any bond or other form of security, and without such act constituting an election of remedies or disentitling Cru to each and every remedy available at law or in equity for a breach of this Agreement by you.

	12.	Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CRU WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THIS MOBILE APP; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY IN THIS MOBILE APP, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.  IN NO EVENT WILL CRU’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS MOBILE APP EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00).

	13.	Arbitration
Unless you are an employee of Cru and subject to Cru’s internal dispute resolution policy, for any dispute you have with Cru regarding this Mobile App, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  If Cru has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  Unless you and Cru agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the state or federal courts in Orange County, Florida, United States of America.  Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.  The award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Mobile App.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CRU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

	14.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.  We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court in Orange County, Florida for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).

This Mobile App is controlled and operated from the United States of America, and we make no representations that it is appropriate or available for use in other locations.

	15.	General Terms
Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms.  Cru reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose.  We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted.  If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you.  By continuing to access or use this Mobile App after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.  If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using this Mobile App.

Assignment.  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Cru without restriction.  Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof will be null and void.

Entire Agreement/Severability.  These Terms, together with the Privacy Notice and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Cru in connection with this Mobile App, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Cru concerning this Mobile App.  If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

No Waiver.  No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Cru’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</string>
