Cru’s technology and all intellectual property embodied in, or associated with the technology are owned by and are the property of Cru, and subject to applicable patent, copyright, trade secrets, trademarks and other proprietary rights.  The technology is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of this Agreement.  Cru reserves all rights not expressly granted to the User.  The technology and any authorized copies you make thereof are the intellectual property of Cru.  The structure, organization, and code of the technology are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Cru. The technology is protected by law, including without limitation the copyright laws of the United States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as expressly stated herein, this Agreement does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the technology. The technology may be covered by one or more pending patent applications.

10. THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS
In the event any claim is brought against you alleging that the technology or your possession and use of the technology breaches any third-party’s intellectual property rights, your sole remedy is to immediately notify Cru in writing. Cru shall not be liable for any defense, settlement, or discharge of such claim, except as provided in the preceding sentence. You agrees that, in the event Cru notifies you to immediately cease using the technology due to a third-party claim of infringement, regulatory or legal requirement or for any other reasonable purpose, you shall do so promptly

11. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
You agree that in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement, Cru shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, or both, in each case without the requirement to post any bond or other form of security, and without such act constituting an election of remedies or disentitling Cru to each and every remedy available at law or in equity for a breach of this Agreement by you.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CRU WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THIS MOBILE APP; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY IN THIS MOBILE APP, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

13. ARBITRATION
Unless you are an employee of Cru and subject to Cru’s internal dispute resolution policy, for any dispute you have with Cru regarding this Mobile App, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  If Cru has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  Unless you and Cru agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the state or federal courts in Orange County, Florida, United States of America.  Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.  The award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Mobile App.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CRU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

14. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.  We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court in Orange County, Florida for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).

This Mobile App is controlled and operated from the United States of America, and we make no representations that it is appropriate or available for use in other locations.

Cru reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose.

By continuing to access or use this Mobile App after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.  If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using this Mobile App.

Assignment.  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Cru without restriction.  Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof will be null and void.

Entire Agreement/Severability.  These Terms, together with the Privacy Notice and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Cru in connection with this Mobile App, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Cru concerning this Mobile App.  If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

No Waiver.  No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Cru’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</string>

A. EDITING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Please make sure to provide us with all the information we need to be able to address your request, including both the old and new information.

   •   for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
   •   to comply with our legal obligations;
   •   to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; or
   •   to perform a task in the public interest.

If this is the case, we will notify you of the reasons why your request was rejected.

D. RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.
You have the right to request us to limit the processing of your personal information if:

   •   you dispute the accuracy of your personal information;
   •   your personal information was processed unlawfully and you request a limitation on processing, rather than a deletion of your personal information;
   •   we no longer need to process your personal information, but you need your personal information in connection with a legal claim; or
   •   you object to the processing of your personal information based on our legitimate interests pending verification as to whether we have an overriding legitimate ground for such processing.

To the extent needed, we may still keep some of your data to ensure we comply with your request to limit processing, or for other legal purposes.

E. OBJECTING TO CERTAIN TYPES OF PROCESSING INCLUDING AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING.
Where we process your personal information based upon our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to this processing on grounds relating to your particular situation if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

Where we process your personal information based upon our legitimate interests and where decisions are made by automated processing which has a legal or other significant effect on you, you may also object to such automated decision making.

F. PORTABILITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.
You can request us to send you your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format so that it can easily be transferred and used by a third party if:

   •   you provided us with the personal information;
   •   the processing of your personal information is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract; or
   •   the processing is carried out by automated means.

G. WITHDRAWING CONSENT.
We primarily rely on legitimate business interests to process your data, but to the extent we use consent to process your data, you have the right to withdraw any consent you may have given us at any time. We will comply with your request promptly.

If you withdraw your consent, we might not be able to provide some of our products and services to you. At any point, you have the right to object to processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes and we will promptly comply with your request.

H. FILING A COMPLAINT WITH A DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY.
We will try to resolve any problems that you have but you are always able to contact your local data protection authority for assistance or to make a complaint.

7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
We are an international organisation and we might need to transfer your personal information to other countries. If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), please be aware that we may need to transfer your data to countries outside the EEA to process it. We will only transfer your personal information outside the EEA with adequate safeguards in place and in full compliance with applicable laws. For example, we will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection. We have established standard contractual clauses with our service providers to ensure they protect your information and to enforce legal transfers of data internationally.

8. SECURITY.
We have put in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from being accidentally lost, misused or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. These include technical, administrative and physical security measures to ensure that any information we collect is stored and processed securely.

For example, for Digital Tools that require personal or sensitive data to be collected or displayed, a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) connection is required, to ensure that the data is encrypted as it is transferred to the browser. All credit card payments are processed using PCI compliant technology, to ensure that your credit card number is securely passed to the merchant/service provider. We do not store your credit card details.

We have procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and we will promptly notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach in accordance with our legal obligations.
We cannot guarantee that the security measures we implement in connection with the operation of the site will absolutely prevent others from accessing or acquiring any information that you provide while using the site. You can help us protect your personal information by properly protecting your password and remembering to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish visiting our site, especially if you are on a shared or public computer.

9. COOKIES AND INFORMATION COLLECTED BY TECHNOLOGY.
The digital tool may use cookies to keep track of web site activities, save your password or deliver content specific to your interests. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. You can find out more about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience certain interactive features of the site or access all of the services provided through the site.

10. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
We keep your information as long as it is needed to achieve our purposes listed above, as well as for the amount of time necessary to meet any legal, tax, or reporting requirements.

We do not keep your personal information for longer than necessary and up to 7 years after your last interaction with us (e.g. making a donation, registering for an event, or using one of our Digital Tools). We may keep your data for longer than 7 years for legal or technical reasons. We may also keep it for statistical purposes. However, if we do, we will ensure that your privacy continues to be protected and only use it for these purposes.

11. THIRD PARTY SITES AND INFORMATION.
The site may contain links to Digital Tools that are run by third parties such as other organizations, sponsors, content providers and advertisers. Once you’ve clicked on a link or button activator for an outside website, you will leave the site and be taken to sites that we do not control, and our privacy policy no longer applies on those sites.

You must read the privacy policy of the third party website concerning how personal information will be used. We also provide content created by third parties on some of our Digital Tools. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such content providers or third party sites.

12. SPECIAL RULES FOR CHILDREN.
We do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 beyond what is necessary for them to participate in our online or other activities, such as registering for a conference or downloading materials. If we discover that we have accidentally collected personal information from a child below the age of 13, we will delete it from our records as soon as reasonably possible.

If a child, under the age of 16 in the EEA, or under the age of 13 elsewhere, attempts to register with one of our Digital Tools, purchase products or materials, or participate in an activity requiring the submittal of personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian must give permission and consent for that child to provide information and register. The only personal information we collect from a child is information that is necessary for the child to participate in activities, such as an address for making a purchase. Parents have the right to request at any time that the information collected about their child is removed from our database.

13. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2018 will receive information regarding 2017 sharing activities). Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements.
