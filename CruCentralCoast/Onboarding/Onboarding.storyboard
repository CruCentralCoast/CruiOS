	9.	Ownership.  
Cru’s technology and all intellectual property embodied in, or associated with the technology are owned by and are the property of Cru, and subject to applicable patent, copyright, trade secrets, trademarks and other proprietary rights.  The technology is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of this Agreement.  Cru reserves all rights not expressly granted to the User.  The technology and any authorized copies you make thereof are the intellectual property of Cru.  The structure, organization, and code of the technology are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Cru. The technology is protected by law, including without limitation the copyright laws of the United States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as expressly stated herein, this Agreement does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the technology. The technology may be covered by one or more pending patent applications.

	10.	Third-Party Claims. 
In the event any claim is brought against you alleging that the technology or your possession and use of the technology breaches any third-party’s intellectual property rights, your sole remedy is to immediately notify Cru in writing. Cru shall not be liable for any defense, settlement, or discharge of such claim, except as provided in the preceding sentence. You agrees that, in the event Cru notifies you to immediately cease using the technology due to a third-party claim of infringement, regulatory or legal requirement or for any other reasonable purpose, you shall do so promptly

	11.	Injunctive Relief.  
You agree that in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement, Cru shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, or both, in each case without the requirement to post any bond or other form of security, and without such act constituting an election of remedies or disentitling Cru to each and every remedy available at law or in equity for a breach of this Agreement by you.

	12.	Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CRU WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THIS MOBILE APP; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY IN THIS MOBILE APP, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

	13.	Arbitration
Unless you are an employee of Cru and subject to Cru’s internal dispute resolution policy, for any dispute you have with Cru regarding this Mobile App, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  If Cru has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  Unless you and Cru agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the state or federal courts in Orange County, Florida, United States of America.  Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.  The award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Mobile App.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CRU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

	14.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.  We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court in Orange County, Florida for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).
